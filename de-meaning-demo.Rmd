Let's denote income as Y and age as X:

Y = -9048.776 + 446.0501X - 4.9506X^2

Now, let's find the derivative of Y with respect to X:

dY/dX = 446.0501 - 9.9012*X

To find the age at which the slope is zero, set dY/dX equal to zero and solve for X:

446.0501 - 9.9012*X = 0

9.9012*X = 446.0501

X = 446.0501 / 9.9012 â‰ˆ 45.00

```{r}

demo_df_l45 <- demo_df %>%
  filter(age < 45)


# Fit a quadratic regression model
lm_l45_model <- lm(income ~ age , data = demo_df_l45)

# Summary of the model
summary(lm_l45_model)

# Visualize the relationship
ggplot(lm_l45_model, aes(x = age, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Quadratic Relationship Between Age and Income",
    x = "Age",
